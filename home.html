                USC Title 38 – Veterans Benefits is a code written by the U.S. Government in the 1950s, specifically on September 2nd, 1958. Since then, it has been amended many times, with the current version of Title 38 being from 2011. This document is split into 6 different parts, each part has a number of chapters, subchapters, and supplemental information. In an effort to be as comprehensive as possible, this document is packed with so much information that is extends to 1,215 pages in total. Some parts are longer than others, but each has a specific topic that is supported in great depth by the many sub-sections of each. 
<br>
                In order, these parts cover:
<ul>
<li>Part 1: General Provisions</li>
<li>Part 2: General Benefits</li>
<li>Part 3: Readjustment and Related Benefits</li>
<li>Part 4: General Administrative Provisions</li>
<li>Part 5: Boards, Administrations, and Services</li>
<li>Part 6: Acquisition and Disposition of Property</li>
</ul>
These are then broken down even further into chapters, subchapters, and sections, with each respective chunk getting into further and further detail on a specific topic. Some parts are longer and more general than others, while some delve into very specific topics.</p>

<p>Part 1 is a smaller part, only consisting of 5 chapters. It defines the terminology of the document, spelling out what means what. In addition, it covers the general information of the Department of Veterans Affairs, from employees of the department, security and law enforcement, to the duties and responsibilities of the higher ups in the organization.</p>

<p>Part 2 mainly covers the core of the benefits offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As such, this is a longer section, holding 10 chapters. These begin with compensation for service-connected disability or death, but also cover things such as non-service connected issues, burial benefits, benefits for homeless veterans, and even insurance.</p>

<p>Part 3 is the next main section covering core benefits on offer. These are unrelated to death and disability and instead focus on benefits that assist veterans with their lives after ending their time in service. It details things such as educational assistance programs, dependent education, housing and business loans, job counseling and career services, and adaptive equipment for disabled veterans.</p>

<p>Part 4 is shorter, now getting out of the core benefits from Title 38. It covers administrative provisions, such as claims and payments. These chapters detail the processes of how to gain the benefits outlined in the previous parts. Part 4 also specifies wards of veterans, as well as how to lose benefits through the penal system and other methods.</p>

<p>Part 5 discusses the board of appeals for veterans, with details on the court of appeals for veterans’ claims. The chapters here discuss the Health Administration in depth, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and several related programs.</p>

<p>Part 6 is the final part of the document, and is also the shortest, holding only four chapters. These cover how to set up and run hospital and domiciliary facilities, how to procure supplies, and how to establish medical schools along with affiliated grants. In addition, as the final part, it discusses the disposition of a deceased veteran’s personal property.</p>

<p>While extensive and difficult to navigate for those not used to Government documentation, USC Title 38 covers nearly everything necessary for the Department of Veterans Affairs to function, as well as almost any possible situation in which a Veteran may need aid. From medical assistance, education and aid with finding work, to dependents and even what the family gets in the event of a veterans death. </p>
